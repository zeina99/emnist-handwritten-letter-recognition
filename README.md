# emnist-handwritten-letter-recognition

# Introduction

This project uses the EMNIST dataset 'letters' category to train a CNN model on recognizing handwritten english letters. 

# File structure
- emnist-training.ipynb: this contains training and testing different architectures to find the best architecture to train the CNN model
- emnist-testing.ipynb: this imports the saved model and a handwritten image to test the model prediction on
- images/ : contains an image of a handwritten letter
- final_model/ : the exported trained model saved from emnist-training.ipynb


# Results
The best model architecture had a loss of 0.2020 and accuracy of 0.9315
